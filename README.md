# kickstarter_analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this challenge is to show a thorough knowledge of Excel and to create an analysis on theater based on a given data set.

## Analysis and Challenges

The main challenge I encountered was utilizing the COUNTIFS formulas. I have never had to use this formula, so it was pretty new to me. I watched the video on how to add multiple factors when comparing the data based on goals. I would say it took me over an hour to finally grasp. I also threw myself off in the beginning because I forgot to use quotations around the specific variables.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

1. The first conclusion is out of 1,369 plays, 839 (61%) were successful and 493 (36%) failed. Only 37 (3%) were cancelled. 

2. The second conclusion is that the most successful months for theater are May and June. May had a success rate of 67%, and June had a success rate of 65%.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

1. The majority of the data is limited to the goal of 1000 to 4999. 

2. The total amount of successful plays was 694 (66%), and the total failed was 353 (34%). Also, the plays with a goal over 10000 had a 46% success rate and a 54% failure rate.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

With regards to the Outcomes Based on Goals analysis, the majority of the data is limited to the goal of 1000 to 4999 (56%). The goal amounts should be changed to reflect more detailed information.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

We could create an analysis of success rates based on country. This could be a bar graph. Another bar graph could be created based on the other parent categories.
